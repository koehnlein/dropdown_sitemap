# TYPO3 Extension "dropdown_sitemap"
The Drop-Down sitemap plugin adds a new kind of menu/sitemap to the T3 content elements. It uses HTML list elements, CSS and JS (Scriptaculous or Mootools) to generate a drop-down map of the website, with the possibility to expand/collapse every section.

## !! Attention !!
This is an **automatically** generated git version, based on the release into the [TYPO3 Extension Repository](http://www.typo3.org/extensions/).
You can find the original version at http://typo3.org/extensions/repository/view/dropdown_sitemap/ .

It does not make sense to make pull requests as this repository has been created automatically from 3rd party, not from the original author(s).

Every version of the extension is tagged with the version number, therefore you can switch quite easily between different versions.
